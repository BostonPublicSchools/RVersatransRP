Title: Retrieve and format data from a Versatrans Routing and Planning Database.
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Ista Zahn
Maintainer: Ista Zahn <izahn@bostonpublicschools.org>
Description: Versatrans Routing and Planning databases can be queried directly
    via SQL. This is useful, but often the data returned from such queries needs
    to be extensively reformatted, summarized, or stored in different formats
    for use by other tools. For example, it is sometimes useful to store RP 
    query results as google sheets for use in constructing dashboards. The 
    RVersatransRP package makes it easier to carry out these data 
    post-processing and storage tasks.
